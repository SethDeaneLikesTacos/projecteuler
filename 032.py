We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital
if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly
once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is
1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity,
39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier,
and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplie
/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one
way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
